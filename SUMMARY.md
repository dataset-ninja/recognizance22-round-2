**Recognizance'22 Round 2** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 1200 images with 6097 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cell*).

Images in the Recognizance'22 Round 2 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 200 (17% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (1000 images) and *test* (200 images). The dataset was released in 2022.
