Cell Segmentation is a task of splitting a microscopic image domain into segments, which represent individual instances of cells. It is a fundamental step in many biomedical studies, and it is regarded as a cornerstone of image-based cellular research. Cellular morphology is an indicator of a physiological state of the cell, and a well-segmented image can capture biologically relevant morphological information.
